 ðŸ‘‹ Good day! My name is Gee and this is my GeeEq profile. 
 I am still a beginner at Front end but the day will come for I will be a Jedi of Front End !
Looking for a Junior position to polish my new found skills and gain the wisdom of the Great Web ! ðŸ˜„
As you perhaps see in my work so far, theres still loads to work on and my strongest skills come with CSS 
(HTML is fun, but you know, when theres React you only need a div with id:root more or less)
Currently finnishing my 7 months long courses of Front End web development,
looking for a full time position, with opporunity to grow in all directions as the need arises, so I will emerce myself into digital space of creation.

Thanks for your time,
Have a great day!
GeeEq
